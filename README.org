* About
Flappy-Barb is a side scrolling game where you take a role of a barbarian who has beef with some birds and his rage takes him into the sky to fight them.

The goal of the game is to achieve the highest score and combo before the birds overwhelm the barbarian.

* How to play
The game is played using just one button. Press spacebar when in play to swing your axe which also pushes the barbarian upwards. Don't let yourself touch the ground or fly too high and swing when you're about to hit an obstacle.

You get awarded points for hitting birds and the more you hit without letting any pass, the more your combo meter will increase, which will award you more points as it grows.
